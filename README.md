# Benji-Portfolio

## My Portfolio

In this second challenge I was tasked with creating a portfolio that tested my ability to create a webpage from scratch. Combining what I've learned so

far in regards to HTML and CSS.

## Features of the webpage

This webpage contains text in the header that links to another part of the page and links in the footer that link to my github repository for this portfolio.

##  How to View

To access the webpage visit my github repository at this linked address https://github.com/Benjiwildcat/Benji-Portfolio from there you should be able to click

on the "index.html and copy it. After copying the code, paste it into vs code and right click the mouse. Select open in default browser, to view the webpage.

## Process and personal thoughts

I understand that this isn't necessarily part of a Traditional README however, I did something like this in my first challenge and I want to continue in this 

challenge as well. I'm doing it as sort of a diary too look back on months or years down the line to see how I bookmarked my thoughts and progress regarding 

programming. This challenge showed me that I had much to learn when it came to CSS. I struggle at the moment to correctly identify class selectors and the order

of which I'm supposed to label them to make noticeable changes to my webpages. HTML is simple enough after a little practice but the logic behind CSS semantics 

seems to still evade my understanding. I really wanted this webpage to look as good as I could make it but I wasted so much time on little details and eventually

found myself frustrated and having lost motivation. I'd done so much but there was still so much more I could've done. In time though, a lot of the nuances of 

programming will make sense, I figure frustration is just a part of the process of learning.
